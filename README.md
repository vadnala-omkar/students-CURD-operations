🚀 Project Update: Server-Side Rendering Application using Node.js & Express.js

I developed a server-side rendered web application using Node.js and Express.js, following the MVC (Model–View–Controller) architecture for better structure and scalability.

The project manages basic student data such as name, age, roll number, contact details, and address, and exposes a REST API with full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). Server-side rendering improves performance, SEO, and overall user experience.

This project strengthened my understanding of backend development, MVC design patterns, RESTful APIs, and real-world deployment challenges.
